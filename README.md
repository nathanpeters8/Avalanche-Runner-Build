Known Bugs and Unfinished Mechanics:

- Jump animation doesn't always trigger when player jumps
- Left/Right move animations can be a little delayed
- Player hitbox needs improvement; collision with barriers can happen when they shouldn't
- Main menu background needs stability improvements; after a while it lags due to big number of assets
- This build doesn't remove button for submitting stats to leaderboard after clicked
- This build doesn't limit the initials for leaderboard to 3 characters
